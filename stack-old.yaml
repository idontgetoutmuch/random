  # We require a splitmix version that supports the "random" flag. When this
  # flag is set to false, splitmix does not depend on the random package. We
  # require the flag to be set to false to avoid a circular dependency:
  #     random -> splitmix -> random.
  # The oldest splitmix version to support the "random" flag is 0.0.3. LTS
  # snapshots prior to lts-14 contain older versions of splitmix. To make sure
  # the build goes through, we pin the splitmix version here.
  #
  # Note that although the resolver defined in this file comes with a splitmix
  # >= 0.0.3 by default, this stack.yaml is also used in CI, where the resolver
  # is overridden, making this explicit pinning of splitmix necessary.
  #
  # In addition, the doctests require 'SMGen' from the splitmix package to
  # implement 'Prim'. So far, this is only the case on lehin's fork, so we use
  # that.
